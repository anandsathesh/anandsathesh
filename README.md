## 🎯 About Me

I’m an Electronics & Communication Engineering undergraduate passionate about building real-world systems in **Robotics, Embedded Systems, and AI/ML**.  
Over time, I’ve translated academic learning into functioning projects—ranging from drones and robots to brain-computer interface systems.

This repository is a hub of my technical work: **code, documentation, demos, experiments**, and more.

## 📈 Why Me / What I Bring

- **Hands-on thinker**: I focus on delivering working systems/products, not just theory.  
- **Full-stack embedded → AI pipeline**: From sensors to ML models, I cover the stack.  
- **Rapid prototyping & iteration**: I structure code to be modular, testable, and maintainable.  
- **Learning mindset**: I constantly pick up new tools/libraries (e.g. ROS2, newer ML architectures) to stay current.
